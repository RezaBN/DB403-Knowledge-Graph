# DB403-Knowledge-Graph
In this exercise, we create a simple knowledge graph from the content of a dataset named 'wiki_sentences_v2.csv'. This graph will include concepts extracted from the text and the relationships between them. After creating the knowledge graph, we connect it to a Neo4j database and query it using Cypher. We execute 7 queries to explore the graph.
